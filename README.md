### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I am student of 2nd year on PJAIT. Actually, I am working as an IT Recruiter. I am absolutely fascinated about IT and coding. I want to get my first job as a developer to improve my skills and getting knowledge under the supervision of more experienced developers. Despite, I am learning about SOLID principals, OOP programming and design patterns, Iâ€™ve got lack in commercial knowledge about writing high quality code and using best technical solutions.
